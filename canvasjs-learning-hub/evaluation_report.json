  "notes": "All features from input_ui_spec.txt have been implemented. The project includes a complete React + TypeScript + Tailwind setup with CanvasJS chart integration. Homepage features multiple animated elements including floating shapes, animated hero chart, staggered content animations, and scroll indicator. All four required pages (Home, Documentation, Examples, Tutorials) are fully implemented with proper navigation. Documentation covers all specified topics. Examples include Line, Bar, and Pie charts with live rendering. Tutorials provide step-by-step learning with code snippets and chart outputs. The codebase follows strict TypeScript configuration with no 'any' types. Responsive design is implemented with mobile menu and breakpoint-aware layouts. Accessibility features include ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and focus indicators."
